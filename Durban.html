<font color="red"><h3 align="center">Located on eastern coast of South Africa, Durban is a great getaway for beach lovers longing for a relaxed atmosphere. But don't let the year-round tropical climate and its warm temperatures fool you into thinking that "relaxed" means "boring." This area is a gateway to all kinds of experiences, including outings to the botanic gardens, beach events, shopping and cultural attractions. No matter what time of year you visit, Durban holidays are filled with lounging opportunities and leisurely pastimes that support 
a Zen state of mind and minimum brain drain.
